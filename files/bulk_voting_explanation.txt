Starting keyword theme voting.

Enter a keyword. The program will then look for themes containing that keyword. You then have the ability to vote YES/NO for all of them at once.
If you only want to vote for certain themes, include their index in the command. For example, 'Y 2 3 12' will vote YES for themes 2, 3 and 12.
You can also use multiple commands in one line.  For example, 'N 1 2 Y' will vote NO for themes 1 and 2, but yes for the rest.

To prevent abuse, you can only flag one theme at a time. Make sure to include its index.
